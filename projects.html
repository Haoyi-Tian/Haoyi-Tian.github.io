            <p>This robot was a team project for the robot contest in MAE3 (Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Design). The goal was to build a user-controlled robot that could transport blocks from various locations on the playing field and deposit them in a designated area to score points.</p>

            <p>The goal of this project was to design a pair of cams for a laser "lightshow" setup. A laser rests on the two cams, and thus its position is dependent on the varying radii of the cams. A desired path for the laser was first specified, then the cams were created based on this desired laser path.</p>

            <p>This project is what you are viewing right now&mdash;my portfolio. I needed a place to showcase the projects, big and small, that I've done. Starting from almost zero HTML and CSS knowledge whatsoever, I learned enough online to code this site from scratch. There's not really much else to say since the portfolio itself is the product here, hence the lack of a separate project page.</p>
