        <!--<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">These are projects that don't focus specifically on Arduino, SolidWorks, or MATLAB, but instead are based on a combination of tools and methods. Pages for those specialized projects can be accessed through the sidebar navigation.</h3>-->
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">This page is a collection of various projects not related to flight. Many projects involve a combination of several methods and tools, while some are focused on specifically one (such as Arduino or MATLAB).</h3>

            <h3 style="padding: 0px;">RC Airplane Design and Build Project I</h3>
            <p>This project was initiated out of personal interest and the desire to fly a remote controlled airplane. Everything was originally designed and built from scratch except for the electrical components (motor, battery, etc). This was the first attempt at making an RC airplane, so the primary goal was to learn some basics about building and to achieve somewhat controlled flight. The project page is still a work in progress.</p>

            <h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 5px 0px;">Cam-Guided Laser Image Tracing</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project was to design a pair of cams for a laser "lightshow" setup. A laser pointer rests on the two cams, its position dependent on the varying radii of the cams. A desired path for the laser was first specified before the cams were designed and fabricated based on this desired laser path.</p>

            <p>This robot was a team project for the robot contest in MAE3 (Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Design). The goal was to build a user-controlled robot that could transport blocks from various locations on the playing field and deposit them in a designated area to score points.</p>

            <p>This MATLAB project uses finite element analysis to characterize a 2D truss shaped like a power transmission-line tower. Varying loads can be applied to the two overhanging arms to examine the deformation of each member and to visualize the truss under load.</p>

            <p>This Arduino project uses a thermistor to calculate temperature and display it on an LCD panel in both Celcius and Fahrenheit scales. The main goal of this project was to practice using the LCD display, while the thermistor was included to add some additional functionality and turn it into a thermometer.</p>

            <!--<p>This project is what you are viewing right now&mdash;my portfolio. I needed a place to showcase the projects, big and small, that I've done. Starting from almost zero HTML and CSS knowledge whatsoever, I learned enough online to code this site from scratch. There's not really much else to say since the portfolio itself is the product here, hence the lack of a separate project page.</p>-->
            <p>The project here is this portfolio. It serves as a place to showcase the application of my various skills in all types of projects. It was also an interesting challenge because I initiated it with almost zero html/CSS knowledge. There isn't much complexity to this project and it's constantly evolving, hence the lack of a separate project page.</p>
