        <!--<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">These are projects that don't focus specifically on Arduino, SolidWorks, or MATLAB, but instead are based on a combination of tools and methods. Pages for those specialized projects can be accessed through the sidebar navigation.</h3>-->
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">This page is a collection of various projects not related to flight. Many projects involve a combination of several methods and tools, while some are focused on specifically one (such as Arduino or MATLAB).</h3>

            <h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 5px 0px;">Robot Design</h3>
            <p>This robot was a team project for the robot contest in MAE3 (Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Design). The goal was to build a user-controlled robot that could transport blocks from various locations on the playing field and deposit them in a designated area to score points.</p>

            <h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 5px 0px;">Cam Design</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project was to design a pair of cams for a laser "lightshow" setup. A laser rests on the two cams, and thus its position is dependent on the varying radii of the cams. A desired path for the laser was first specified, then the cams were created based on this desired laser path.</p>

            <h3 style="padding: 0px;">Thermometer</h3>
            <p>This Arduino project uses a thermistor to calculate temperature and display it on an LCD panel in both Celcius and Fahrenheit scales. The main goal of this project was to practice using the LCD display, while the thermistor was included to add some additional functionality and turn it into a thermometer.</p>

            <!--<p>This project is what you are viewing right now&mdash;my portfolio. I needed a place to showcase the projects, big and small, that I've done. Starting from almost zero HTML and CSS knowledge whatsoever, I learned enough online to code this site from scratch. There's not really much else to say since the portfolio itself is the product here, hence the lack of a separate project page.</p>-->
            <p>This project consists of this portfoil. It serves as a place to showcase the application of my various skills in all types of projects. It was also an interesting challenge because I initiated it with almost zero html/CSS knowledge. There isn't much complexity to this project and it's constantly evolving, hence the lack of a separate project page.</p>
