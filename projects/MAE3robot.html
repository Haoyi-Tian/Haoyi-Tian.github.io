            <p>The goal of this project was to build a robot that could collect blocks from around the playing field and deposit them into a "goal" area to score points.</p>
            <p>The CAD model here shows the playing field, where two teams simultaneously compete. The blocks in the middle (blue) platform are availible to both sides and are worth more, thus offering an advantage to whichever side can claim them first. The stepped platforms on each end of the field serve as the goal areas for each side, where placing blocks on higher steps corresponds to more points. The central rail also offers the option for teams to build rail-mounted robots. The original contest webpage, which includes detailed rules and specifications, can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/mae3-robots/2017-fall" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

This is because the platform edge at each level is not perfectly flush with the sides, causing the edge of the robot scoop to get caught. This was noted quickly and the team carefully worked around it in future operations by making sure to leave a slight gap in front of the scoop when lifting blocks.</p>
            <p>The image here shows the completed robot. The metal scoop in the front stores loaded blocks while the winch in the rear controls the height of the scoop, which slides along the slits in the acrylic wall behind it. There is a metal plate against the back of the scoop that operates via a rack and pinion mechanism, which acts as a pushing wall and deposits the contents of the scoop.</p>
            <p>The bent metal plate in the rear is used to quickly sweep the high value blocks off the middle platform and onto our side of the field. Apart from the obvious point bonus from depositing these blocks, this prevents the opponent from accessing the bulk of them as well. The video is a quick practice run of the robot showing this metal sweep in action, along with the other features of the robot.</p>
            <p>Additionally, each wheel is separately powered by motors while the rear of the robot rests on a 3D printed hemisphere. Together, this delivers more power to the wheels and allows for a very small turn radius. The wiring attached to the robot connects to two controllers, which allows one team member to operate the wheels while the other operates the scoop and pushing wall.</p>

          <h3>Process:</h3>

            <p>Here is an image of one of the first prototypes we created. This prototype was built with the primary intention of testing the scoop mechanism. The rod at the rear acted as a winch powered by a motor fitted to the gear at the end, which was found to be able to comfortably lift the scoop when loaded with over 6 blocks.</p>
            <p>While this was promising, the original idea was to have the robot on 4 wheels, thus the gear on the side would be too obtrusive. Therefore, this mechanism was replaced with a winch which was created by directly attaching a 3D printed spool to the motor. In hindsight, doing this completely changed effective torque output of the motor, which means this prototype didn't accurately represent the capabilities of the winch. Furthermore, the additional mass resulting from using steel as opposed to foam for the scoop wasn't taken into account, which clearly results in again overestimating the ability of the winch. </p>

            <p>After constructing the prototype and making some design changes, the next step was to model the robot through CAD. These two CAD renderings show the robot's scoop and wheels in greater detail. The image showing the wheels illustrates how the robot moves, consistent with the explanations from prior sections.</p>
            <p>The side profile of the scoop may be a bit harder to understand at first glance. The large gray rectangle is the scoop, while the gray cylinders prodruding from it are bolts (there are 4 total, with 2 visible and 2 more behind). These bolts slide along slits that are cut into the blue acrylic sheet, which confines the scoop to vertical motion. The L-bracket is attached to the bottom bolts and serves at a platform for a motor, which operates the pushing wall that is connected to the other end of the rack. This may be more clearly depicted in the rear orthographic view of the CAD model below.</p>

            <p>The image here shows the two parts from above when put together, with the sweeper and winch attched to the rear as well. This rendering should also offer a better view of the scoop and pushing wall mechanism. The animation represents how the robot is designed to collect and deposit blocks.</p>

            <p>These next two images on the right show an initial design for the bottom edge of the scoop (top) and the final design (bottom). After building was nearly complete, the main issue that remained was the inability of the scoop to wedge underneath blocks to pick them up. The most simple way to fix this problem seemed to be by changing the geometry, which some team members tried by cutting out a jagged pattern and sanding down some of the edges. The thinner edge seemed to help the situation but the "teeth" didn't have close to the same impact.</p>
            <p>Luckily for us, we realized that each team was given one strip of steel shim stock as part of the allowed materials. We then glued the thin steel onto the top surface of the base of the scoop at a downward angle such that its edge would rest on the floor. The thinness allowed blocks to be scooped up much more consistently (abeit still not perfectly every time), solving one of the biggest issues we encountered.</p>
