            <p>The ultimate goal of this project was to build an airplane that could successfully fly. As this was my first plane, it also served as a great learning experience (especially from all the mistakes and troubles along the way).</p>
            <p>This image is of the completed aircraft, which I was able to successfully pilot (briefly) under windy conditions after several attempts. There are a few potential causes for the diffuculties, in both the aircraft's build design and in my piloting abilities. These will be summarized below and used to improve the performance of the next aircraft.</p>

            <p>The RC airplane was primarily constructed out of cardboard from a large Amazon box. Large rectangular panels were cut to be folded into airfoils for the wings. As shown in the photo, the cardboard was repeatedly creased near the leading edge to allow for a curvature in the upper surface of the wing. The lower surface, which is shorter than the upper, remained flat. </p>
            <p>Next, strips of cardboard were cut and bent into thin supports (the long pieces resting on the not-yet-assembled wings in the photo) that were inserted into the wings to improve rigidity in the airfoil shapes. Hot glue was used to attach the supports at the thickest point of the airfoil. The surfaces of the wing were then glued together near the trailing edge. An extra flap of cardboard was left attached to each wing, to be used as the ailerons.</p>

            <p>This image shows the completed wing structure with the fuselage and tail in progress. The two wing pieces were glued together with a dihedral angle for increased roll stability. </p>

            <p>After constructing the prototype and making some design changes, the next step was to model the robot through CAD. These two CAD renderings show the robot's scoop and wheels in greater detail. The image showing the wheels illustrates how the robot moves, consistent with the explanations from prior sections.</p>
            <p>The side profile of the scoop may be a bit harder to understand at first glance. The large gray rectangle is the scoop, while the gray cylinders prodruding from it are bolts (there are 4 total, with 2 visible and 2 more behind). These bolts slide along slits that are cut into the blue acrylic sheet, which confines the scoop to vertical motion. The L-bracket is attached to the bottom bolts and serves at a platform for a motor, which operates the pushing wall that is connected to the other end of the rack. This may be more clearly depicted in the rear orthographic view of the CAD model below.</p>

            <p>The image here shows the two parts from above when put together, with the sweeper and winch attched to the rear as well. This rendering should also offer a better view of the scoop and pushing wall mechanism. The animation represents how the robot is designed to collect and deposit blocks.</p>

            <p>These next two images on the right show an initial design for the bottom edge of the scoop (top) and the final design (bottom). After building was nearly complete, the main issue that remained was the inability of the scoop to wedge underneath blocks to pick them up. The most simple way to fix this problem seemed to be by changing the geometry, which some team members tried by cutting out a jagged pattern and sanding down some of the edges. The thinner edge seemed to help the situation but the "teeth" didn't have close to the same impact.</p>
            <p>Luckily for us, we realized that each team was given one strip of steel shim stock as part of the allowed materials. We then glued the thin steel onto the top surface of the base of the scoop at a downward angle such that its edge would rest on the floor. The thinness allowed blocks to be scooped up much more consistently (abeit still not perfectly every time), solving one of the biggest issues we encountered.</p>
