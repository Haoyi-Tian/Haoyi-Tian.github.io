Normal human body temperature is around 37&#176;C.</p>

            <p>There's really not much else to describe&mdash;a thermometer is quite a simple project. The video on the right shows the displayed temperature rise and fall as I place my finger on the thermistor and then remove it.</p>
            <h3 style="display:inline;">Process:</h3>
            <p>The first step was to connect and control the LED display, which involved installing the "LiquidCrystal" library. A potentiometer was connected to control the backlight intensity of the display, allowing for adjustment of the text visibility. An interesting observation is that the best setting for viewing with eyesight results in poor visibility for photos, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>The rest of the project is configuring the thermistor, which draws power from the board and is connected to an analog input pin. The input pin reading is in units ranging from 0 to 1023, which allows the input voltage to be calculated since the original voltage is known. The thermistor forms a voltage divider circuit with the known pull down resistor, so the resistance of the thermistor can be easily calculated at any time.</p>
            <p>Once the resistance is known, the corresponding temperature can be found using the thermistor data sheet, which lists the expected resistance of the thermistor at various given temperatures. In this case, a value was given for temperatures between 0&#176;C and 100&#176;C, in 2&#176;C intervals. To keep things simple, the temperature was determined by linear interpolation of two chosen points on the temperature spectrum. However, this causes the temperature measurements far beyond the range of the two chosen points to be less accurate. This thermometer was intended to measure human body temperature, so the data points were chosen to be 30&#176;C and 44&#176;C, which averages to the normal human body temperature of 37&#176;C for greater measurement accuracy at that range. Using two other pairs of data points (34&#176;C and 40&#176;C, 32&#176;C and 42&#176;C), which also averages to 37&#176;C, yielded very similar results where a slight difference in readings was primarily caused by a very small shift in the temperature intervals.</p>
            <p>When measuring temperatures further away from 37&#176;C, the inaccuracy becomes significant. As seen in the beginning of the video, the ambient room temperature was measured to be around 69&#176;F. While this could be a typical reading for room temperature, the thermostat indicated the actual temperature was 66&#176;F. Plus, it certainly felt cooler than 69&#176;F. This result is expected because as temperature decreases linearly, the resistance of the thermistor increases at an increasing rate. This means that the measured voltage drop, and the resistance calculated from that, actually correspond to a lower temperature value.</p>
            <p>After temperature values were calculated, displaying the value on the LCD is very simple. At this point the temperature was only displayed in degrees Celcius, so I decided to add the reading in degrees Fahrenheit as well. This merely required adding a quick conversion into the code.</p>
            <p>The biggest drawback of this project was the lack of a means to properly test the accuracy of system. I didn't have a thermometer on hand, so the references were the thermostat and my body temperature. There's many others who have probably made almost the exact same thing and posted it on the internet, but for this project I actually put everything together myself based on some past experience and knowlegde with the components.</p>
