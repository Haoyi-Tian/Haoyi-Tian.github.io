            <p>This is a short MATLAB project that focuses on exploring the use of FEA techniques to model the deformation of a 2D truss.</p>
            <p>The structure used here is shown on the right, similar to a power transmission-line tower. In the diagram, 1000lb of force is applied to each overhanging arm, but it can be easily replaced by any other arbitrary value (with some restrictions) to study the effects of a different load magnitude. Each member has a cross-sectional area of 10in<sup>2</sup> and the material has a modulus of elasticity of 29x10<sup>6</sup>psi. These numbers can also easily be substituted, but will be kept constant for this project.</p>
            <h3 style="display:inline;">Process:</h3>
            <p>First, a matrix containing the position of each node should be established, which is pretty simple to do with basic geometry. Next, another matrix should be defined each member by the two nodes it runs between. This also allows the length and angle of each member to be calculated. The truss is plotted at this point so it can be compared to the deformed truss shape later.</p>
            <p>Once this is set up, the stiffness matrices for each member must be set up. A global stiffness matrix can then be formed, relating each of the nodes to each other via the individual stiffness matrices of the members they are attached to. Written into words, this process probably isnt very easy to follow, so the code will be included at the bottom for reference.</p>
            <p>The next step is to partition the global stiffness matrix. This is done to simplify it by removing the rows and columns that correspond to constrained nodes. In this case, rows/columns 1 and 2 correspond to x and y for node 1. Rows/columns 3 and 4 are the same for node 2. Because node 1 is constrained in the y-direction and node 2 is restrained in both-directions, rows/columns 2 through 4 can be "partitioned" or removed from the global stiffness matrix.</p>
            <p>Now, a force vector (zeros) is also created and partitioned to match the size of the partitioned global stiffness matrix. In this case, since the nodes of interest are nodes 11 and 16, and in the y-direction, the 22nd and 32nd indices of the force vector should be changed to non-zero values. It should be noted that a negative sign should be included for a downward force (such as weight), and that the units of force are pounds (lb). Instead of using 1000lb as shown in the diagram, 5000lb is used so that the deformation is more visible. This is also a good time to say that while applying massive loadings to the structure and watching it crumple may be amusing, the model is only meant to be represent the linear elastic regime.</p>
            <p>Thanks to Hooke's law, the displacement of each node can now be solved for with the global stiffness matrix and force vector. However, because these are matrices, the inverse of the global stiffness matrix must be multiplied by the force vector to yield the displacement vector. Luckily, MATLAB is very convenient for this.</p>
            <p>At this point, the three partitioned points (the y-direction for node 1 and both x and y for node 2) need to be added back. The un-partitioned global stiffness matrix can be multiplied with the displacement vector to solve for the x- and y-directional forces at each node. This isn't necessary if displacement is all that's needed, but it's included in the code anyways. The displacement vector is separated into its x- and y-compnents, and added to the original node positions. An extra couple of lines are added in the code to magnify the displacements by 200x&mdash;this is only to make the deformations even more visible when plotted. Finally, the deformed truss can be plotted over the original to visualize the effects of the loads, as shown below.</p>
