            <p>This project is perhaps easier to explain after showing the final product. The video displays the system fully assembled and in action.</p>
            <p>All of the clear acrylic makes up a pre-built mechanism to rotate the cams at appropriate speeds. The yellow acrylic pieces are the two cams, which are designed to guide the laser to trace a block-style capital letter "H" on the projection surface. The laser pointer is held down by a rubber band to confine it to the edges of the cams.</p>

            <p>This MATLAB plot shows the two cams (red and blue), the laser pointer (yellow), as well as the traced path of the laser.</p>
            <p>The shape of the laser's path was simply chosen to be the first letter of my first name. This meant that generating the list of points to form the path was relatively simple, since the shape consisted of only straight lines and right angles.</p>

            <p>In the first graph, the x and y displacements of the laser are plotted for each of the 42 points that make up its path. In the other graph, the radius of each cam is plotted against the angular position.</p>

            <p>These two graphs show the contour of the two cams, each labeled respectively. The contour data is taken from MATLAB and uploaded into SolidWorks to efficiently build the 3D model of each cam.</p>

            <p>After creating each of the cam parts in SolidWorks, they were formed into an assembly with the remaining parts. A time domain simulation was created to see the theoretical path of the laser when the handle is rotated.</p>
            <p>The image here shows a zoomed in view of the completed assembly with the path of the laser tip traced in black.</p>
